Note: I just forked this to adjust the voltage multiplier factor for my (clone?) tester.
I have the one from this image:

![rdclone](screenshots/rdclone.jpg)

I had some trouble getting it to work, but I could pair the tester (passcode: 1234) using blueman Bluetooth Manager on Elementary OS Hera (5.1.3). When disconnecting and reconnecting it created a new /dev/rfcommX interface, but the app tried to connect to the one described in \~/.local/share/rd-usb/config.json.

All the kudos go to kollinger (https://github.com/kolinger/rd-usb) and the work of sebastianha (https://github.com/sebastianha/um34c).

Web GUI for RuiDeng USB testers (UM34C, UM24C, UM25C, TC66C)
==

Simple web GUI written in Python 3. Measurements are stored in sqlite database. Tables and graphs are supported.
Live preview and graphing is also available.

Tested on UM34C/UM24C/UM25C/TC66C.

Based on https://github.com/sebastianha/um34c


Requirements
--
- UM34C/UM24C/UM25C - meter needs to be connected as serial port
    - Pairing with Windows Settings works fine. Pin is 1234. After successful pairing some serial ports are
    installed. In my case two. One of them works.
    - On Linux `rfcomm` and `hcitool` can be used (both provided by bluez package)
        - Retrieve bluetooth address with `hcitool scan`
        - Bind retrieved address to serial port with `rfcomm bind 0 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`. 
        This step is not persistent. Serial port will disappear after reboot. Also rd-usb needs to have permissions to use /dev/rfcommX.
- TC66C - meter is using BLE instead of regular bluetooth so pairing will not work nor RFCOMM will.
    - BLE has very limited support on desktop devices, see used library for supported platforms and versions: 
    https://github.com/hbldh/bleak#features
- TC66C USB - meter connected with USB
    - Meter connected with USB exposes itself as serial port

Installation
--

### Binaries (Win x64 only)
1. Download from [releases](https://github.com/kolinger/rd-usb/releases)
2. Run executable and web server will be shortly spawned on address http://127.0.0.1:5000
3. Application will be probably blocked by Microsoft SmartScreen. For unblock click `More info`
and `Run anyway`. I don't have certificate for signing and application does not have any
reputation so Microsoft will block by default.

### Source code
1. Python 3.4 or newer is required
2. Download from github or `git clone https://github.com/kolinger/rd-usb.git`
3. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run with `python web.py` - this will spawn web server on http://127.0.0.1:5000, port can be changed
with first argument: `python web.py 5555`

On Windows `python` can be found in Python's installation folder.
For example replace `python` with `C:\Python37\python.exe web.py`
and `pip` with `C:\Python37\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

On Linux use `python3` and `pip3`.


Usage
--

**UM34C/UM24C/UM25C Bluetooth or TC66C USB**
1. Select your device version.
2. Name your session. For example 'testing some power bank'. This is
   used to separate multiple measurements from each other.
3. Select sample rate. Faster sample rate will result in more accurate data but also
   will create a lot more data. For short measurements use faster sample rate. For longer
   use slower rate. Choose carefully.
4. Follow Setup link to find your serial port or click Connect if you already have port selected.
5. Connection will be hopefully successful and you will see live measurements in graph.
   Otherwise read log for error messages.

**TC66C Bluetooth**
1. Make sure your OS is supported and has bluetooth with BLE support (Bluetooth Low Energy)
2. Select TC66C from devices and follow with Setup link.
3. Scan for devices and select your device from list by clicking on it
4. After this you can connect simply by using Connect button. Setup is required only for new/different device.
5. Rest is same as other devices. See above.

### Building binaries

1. Install pyinstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
2. Generate binary with provided spec file: `pyinstaller pyinstaller.spec`
3. Binaries will be saved in `dist` directory
